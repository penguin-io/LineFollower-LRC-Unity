### 2. Competition Alignment Overview

**Competition context:** Two cooperative robots (autonomous ALFR and manual SARM) must clear obstacles, trigger three gate-based processes, and verify fluid delivery accuracy within a 10-minute time limit. A scoring breakdown prioritizes arena circuitry, robot capability, pump performance, and unique documentation.

**Technologies selected:**
- **ROS 2 (Humble compatible):** primary middleware for modular control, inter-robot communication, and hardware abstraction.
- **Unity 2022 LTS with Robotics Hub packages:** high-fidelity simulation environment used to prototype kinematics, sensing, and gate flow logic before hardware deployment. Unity also consumes URDF assets and ROS 2 topics via ROS-TCP-Connector.

**Key objectives:**
1. Deliver a cohesive system architecture where ALFR and SARM cooperate without deadlocks at junctions.
2. Guarantee the 125 ml fluid dispensing sequence and associated arena logic meet tolerance and safety expectations.
3. Produce a distinct document reflecting team identity, custom mechanical work, and ROS 2/Unity integration methodology.

### 3. System Architecture Snapshot

| Element | Role | Key Technologies | Rulebook Mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ALFR | Autonomous navigation, gate sequencing, line tracking | ROS 2 navigation stack (custom), Unity physics validation | S.No 3 |
| SARM | Manual obstacle removal, precision placement | ROS 2 teleop, custom cad-designed omni base | S.No 2 & S.No 8 |
| Arena Circuitry | Sensors + actuation for gates, pump, LED, load cell, LCD | Raspberry Pi GPIO, HX711, WS2812B LEDs | S.No 1 |
| Peristaltic Pump | 125 ml dispensing triggered by Gate 1 | Stepper + A4988/TMC2208, fluid calibration | S.No 7 |
| Software Bridge | Unity simulation, ROS 2 communications, data logging | ROS-TCP-Connector, ROS 2 nodes | All S.Nos |

**Operational flow:**
1. ALFR follows the arena line and halts at obstacles or blocked junction markers.
2. SARM teleoperates to remove obstacles (three staged tasks), signaling clearance.
3. Gate 1 crossing triggers fluid delivery; Gate 2 illuminates the LAM insignia; Gate 3 verifies dispense via load cell and updates LCD.
4. Unity simulation replicates this workflow, enabling parameter tuning prior to hardware trials.

---

### 4. Advanced Line Follower Robot (ALFR) — S.No 3

#### 4.1 Mechanical & Sensor Layout
- **Chassis:** low-profile acrylic/Aluminum base with differential drive wheels, caster support, and centralized electronics bay.
- **Sensor array:** 8-channel reflective IR array positioned 18 mm ahead of the front axle, adjustable for line contrast. Each channel includes analog capture (for centroid calculation) and binary thresholding for junction detection.
- **Additional sensing:** forward-facing ultrasonic sensor (15° FOV) for obstacle anticipation and speed modulation near junctions.
- **Electronics:** STM32/Teensy microcontroller interfaced with ROS 2 via micro-ROS or a secondary SBC; LiPo 3S battery with regulator rails (5 V control, 7.4 V motors).

#### 4.2 Control Strategy
- **Line tracking:** weighted center calculation with PD compensation. Gains tuned through Unity simulation sweeps, then validated on hardware. A saturation block limits angular velocity to prevent overshoot on tight turns.
- **Junction policy:** multi-sensor activation triggers a state change to “junction pending.” If obstacle flag remains true (received from SARM or gate sensors), ALFR enters “hold” mode until clearance notification.
- **Gate interaction:** ROS 2 topic `/gates/gX_crossed` is published when Unity or hardware sensors confirm crossing. This ensures deterministic activation of pump (Gate 1), LED array (Gate 2), and load cell check (Gate 3).

#### 4.3 Simulation-to-Hardware Transfer
- Unity replicates wheelbase, mass distribution, and IR sensing noise to approximate real-world behavior.
- ROS 2 nodes in simulation share the same interface as hardware nodes, reducing integration risk when moving to the physical arena.

### 5. Single Arm Robot on Omni Platform (SARM) — S.No 2 & S.No 8

#### 5.1 Custom Mechanical Design (S.No 8)
- **Chassis frame:** bespoke hexagonal platform providing symmetric mounting points for four mecanum wheels. Laser-cut aluminum with cross-bracing to maintain stiffness while keeping weight under 4 kg.
- **Arm assembly:** 4 DoF articulated arm (base rotation, shoulder, elbow, gripper pitch) plus a two-finger parallel gripper. Links are CNC-machined aluminum; joints use NEMA17 steppers with harmonic gearboxes for backlash reduction.
- **Electronics bay:** layered deck containing motor drivers, power distribution board, and on-board compute (Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 5) for ROS 2 nodes.
- **Cable management:** custom 3D-printed ducts route conductors to avoid interference with omnidirectional motion.

#### 5.2 Mobility & Control
- **Drive system:** mecanum wheels permit translation in any direction, enabling precise alignment alongside obstacles.
- **Teleoperation:** ROS 2 `joy_node` feeds into `teleop_twist_joy`, producing `/sarm/cmd_vel` Twist messages. Deadman switches ensure safety.
- **Arm kinematics:** ROS 2 `joint_state_broadcaster` and `joint_trajectory_controller` (or custom node) manage position commands. In simulation, Unity ArticulationBody joints mirror the hardware kinematics.
- **Obstacle workflow:**
  1. Navigate to obstacle using orthogonal strafing.
  2. Deploy arm to grasp obstacle, using wrist pitch to lift.
  3. Place obstacle outside ALFR path, signal clearance via `/sarm/clearance`.

#### 5.3 Customization Highlights
- **Grip adaptability:** interchangeable fingertip pads (TPU inserts) to accommodate cylindrical or rectangular obstacles.
- **Vision augmentation (optional):** forward camera feed displayed to operator to improve manual placement accuracy.

### 6. Peristaltic Pump System — S.No 7

#### 6.1 Hardware Architecture
- **Pump head:** tri-roller design with silicone tubing (3 mm ID) secured by quick-release clamps for maintenance.
- **Actuation:** NEMA17 stepper motor coupled via 3D-printed flex coupler; microstepping through TMC2208 driver ensures smooth flow.
- **Control electronics:** Raspberry Pi GPIO pins control STEP/DIR. Bulk capacitor (220 µF) across VMOT for transient suppression, plus flyback diode network for additional protection.

#### 6.2 Calibration & Accuracy
- **Steps-per-ml calibration:** empirical calibration using load cell data. Sample trial: 1000 microsteps ≈ 15.2 ml; final conversion factor computed as 82 steps/ml for 125 ml target. Factor stored as ROS 2 parameter for quick adjustments.
- **Closed-loop verification:** load cell reading at Gate 3 confirms delivery. If deviation exceeds ±5 g, system prompts manual inspection.

#### 6.3 Safety & Maintenance
- Tubing replaced every 20 cycles to preserve volumetric consistency.
- Pump assembly enclosed to prevent pinch hazards; transparent window allows visual inspection.
- Emergency stop input cuts motor power via relay while preserving control electronics.

### 7. Arena Circuitry Design — S.No 1

#### 7.1 Functional Blocks
1. **Gate Sensors:** three IR break-beam assemblies aligned with track positions. Outputs connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO with hardware debouncing.
2. **Pump Control:** STEP/DIR outputs drive A4988; “Pump ON” indicator LED provides visual feedback.
3. **LED “LAM” Display:** 30-node WS2812B strip shaped to form the letters L-A-M. Controlled via Pi PWM-capable pin through level shifter.
4. **Load Cell & HX711:** load measurement for final stage; board communicates via SPI-like protocol (DOUT/SCK) to the Pi.
5. **LCD Display (16×2 I2C):** final messaging (team name, success/error prompts).

#### 7.2 Power Distribution
- 12 V, 5 A main supply feeds pump motor, stepper driver, and downconverter.
- Buck converter provides regulated 5 V to LEDs, HX711, LCD, sensors.
- Logic rails isolated via optocouplers for pump driver to mitigate back-EMF.
- Each peripheral includes inline fuses (1 A for logic, 3 A for motor) and TVS diodes on sensor lines.

#### 7.3 Signal Topology
- All sensors ground-referenced to Pi. Shielded cables used for load cell to minimize noise.
- Gate sensor signals filtered with RC network (4.7 kΩ/0.1 µF) to suppress ambient light flicker.
- LCD I2C lines incorporate 4.7 kΩ pull-ups; cable length kept under 30 cm.

#### 7.4 Enclosure & Access
- Modular arena control box houses Pi, drivers, and wiring harness. Hinged door with interlock ensures power is disconnected before maintenance.
- Quick-connect headers simplify arena setup breakdown for transport.

### 8. Software & Integration Stack

#### 8.1 ROS 2 Architecture
- **Nodes (Python, located in `ROS2/lrc_arena_nodes/lrc_arena_nodes/`):**
  - `pump_controller`: accepts Gate 1 trigger and drives peristaltic pump STEP/DIR lines.
  - `led_controller`: listens for Gate 2 trigger and manages the WS2812B “LAM” array.
  - `loadcell_lcd_controller`: subscribes to Gate 3 trigger, samples HX711 load cell, and updates LCD content.
  - (Optional extensions: teleoperation mux, ALFR watchdog) — placeholders documented for future iterations but not required for the core workflow.
- **Nodes (Unity C# scripts in `Assets/Scripts/`):**
  - `IRArrayPublisher`: streams IR sensor data using custom `IRArray` message.
  - `SonarPublisher`: reports ultrasonic range for obstacle anticipation.
  - `GateTriggerPublisher`: announces gate crossings (1–3) via Boolean topics.
  - `CmdVelSubscriber`: converts `/sarm/cmd_vel` Twist commands into mecanum wheel velocities.
  - `GripperSubscriber`: maps normalized float commands to the SARM gripper articulation.
- **Topics & Services:**
  - `/alfr/ir_array` (`lrc_arena_msgs/IRArray`), `/alfr/sonar` (`sensor_msgs/Range`), `/alfr/state` (`std_msgs/String`).
  - `/sarm/cmd_vel` (`geometry_msgs/Twist`), `/sarm/gripper/command` (`std_msgs/Float32`).
  - `/gates/g1_crossed`, `/gates/g2_crossed`, `/gates/g3_crossed` (Boolean triggers).
  - `/pump/state`, `/pump/progress`, `/load_cell/weight`, `/lcd/display`, `/led/lam_state` for arena device feedback.
  - Optional services exposed by arena nodes to recalibrate pump throughput or update LCD media from an operator console.

#### 8.2 Unity Simulation Workflow
- URDF models of ALFR and SARM are prepared in SolidWorks, exported to URDF using the Unity Robotics Hub guidelines, and imported through the **URDF Importer** package (tutorial reference: `tutorials/urdf_importer/urdf_tutorial.md`). Practical notes include adjusting articulation damping and ensuring mesh scaling is 1.0.
- The Unity scene (`Assets/Scenes/Main.unity`) embeds: arena mesh derived from the provided CAD, gate colliders with trigger scripts, physics materials for line vs. floor friction, and sensor emulation behaviours tied to the IR array and sonar publishers.
- ROS communication is bridged by **ROS-TCP-Connector** configured in ROS 2 protocol mode. Unity menu path: `Robotics → ROS Settings` to set IP/port (default 10000). Message generation follows the **ROS–Unity Integration** tutorial (`tutorials/ros_unity_integration/publisher.md`, `subscriber.md`) ensuring consistent namespace mapping.
- Pick-and-place tutorial patterns (`tutorials/pick_and_place/3_pick_and_place.md`) inspired the articulation hierarchy for the SARM arm and the usage of trajectories; we adapted these to mecanum locomotion by scripting wheel drive targets instead of joint trajectories.
- Simulation sessions emit CSV/JSON logs capturing line error, motor commands, and gate timestamps for later comparison with hardware bag files.

#### 8.3 Message & Package Management
- ROS 2 message package `lrc_arena_msgs` defines `IRArray.msg` and is built via `colcon build`. Unity generates corresponding C# message classes through `Robotics → Generate ROS Messages` (point to `ROS2/lrc_arena_msgs`).
- Arena node package `lrc_arena_nodes` uses `ament_python`. Launch file `arena_devices.launch.py` starts pump, LED, and verification nodes with configurable parameters (`pump_steps_per_ml`, `led_count`, etc.).
- Dependency alignment with tutorials: `rosdep install` is used to pull `rpigpio`, `hx711`, `rpi_ws281x`, and `RPLCD` equivalents when deploying to Pi. For simulation-only runs, nodes fall back to mock drivers (console logging).

#### 8.4 Tutorial Alignment & Enhancements
- **URDF Importer Tutorial (Unity Robotics Hub):** followed for converting SARM and ALFR CAD—specific adjustments include setting collision geometry to primitive proxies for runtime performance and using articulation drives for each joint.
- **ROS–Unity Integration Tutorial:** informed the design of publisher/subscriber scripts. We extended the examples to support custom messages (`IRArray`) and mechanum drive subscribers, maintaining the tutorial’s initialization pattern (`ROSConnection.GetOrCreateInstance`).
- **Pick-and-Place Tutorial:** guided our articulation configuration, topic naming conventions, and Unity-to-ROS workflow. While the original tutorial focuses on MoveIt trajectories, we reused the approach for gating gripper commands and simulating articulated motion in Unity prior to hardware implementation.
- Documentation cross-reference ensures anyone familiar with the tutorials can map our implementation back to the canonical steps, making onboarding smoother for new team members.

#### 8.5 Validation Strategy
- **Digital twin alignment:** parameters (mass, friction, sensor offsets) iteratively tuned until Unity trajectories match hardware within ±5% for key maneuvers.
- **Stress tests:** scenario library covers worst-case obstacle placements, pump misfires, and communication delays. ROS 2 bag files capture outcomes for retrospective analysis.

### 9. Custom Components & Identity Elements

- **SARM chassis & arm:** fully bespoke CAD, exported as neutral STL/STEP for manufacturing. Unity asset maintains accurate collision volumes.
- **Arena aesthetic:** team-branded LED patterns and LCD messages. The LED banner cycles "RoboPenguins" with a cyan-to-white gradient to reinforce branding, and LCD splash screens display the team roster during idle states.
- **Documentation identity:** this design document features team-specific figure references (to be inserted with photos/diagrams before submission) and references unique parameter choices, meeting S.No 9 scoring for distinctive documentation.

---

### 10. Testing & Commissioning Plan

1. **Bench testing:** evaluate arena circuitry on workbench; validate pump dispense accuracy (3-run average within ±2 ml) and LED/LCD behaviors.
2. **Robot subsystem checks:**
   - ALFR: confirm line tracking over varying surface reflectivity, verify stop-and-wait logic at each gate.
   - SARM: verify joystick responsiveness, arm precision, and obstacle relocation repeatability.
3. **Integrated dry runs:** simulate full challenge sequence in Unity, then replicate on hardware with safety observers.
4. **Performance logging:** capture ROS 2 bag files during official practice runs; analyze time to completion, pump accuracy, and load cell metrics.
